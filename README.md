# Number-Plate-Detection-System
A real-time Number Plate Detection System using Python and OpenCV . This project captures video from a camera, detects number plates in the frames, and draws rectangles around the detected plates. The system can be used as a building block for various applications such as parking management, traffic monitoring, and law enforcement.

Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Computer Vision Library: OpenCV
Machine Learning Model: Haar Cascade Classifier (pre-trained)
Camera Interface: OpenCV VideoCapture
